Installation:

To install simply compile the java code.
There is an ANT script for compiling every thing and makeing an jar file!

It's highly recomended you compile thru ANT.
If ANT is installed on your computer all you need to do to install it is to browse to the root dir
for StagedIT in your favorite terminal and write ant.

This will compile everything and jar it.

If you don't know how to intall ant, google how to install ant or compile your self with the right classpaths!
